# Coffee-Machine
Coffee-Machine is a project that I did when I was learning python from JETBRAINS ACADEMY

When the program begins it ask the user to choose which action to perform. Action are: "buy, fill, take, remaining, exit"

The Coffee-Machine initially contains:
400 of water,
540 of milk,
120 of coffee beans,
9 of disposable cups,
$550 of money.

The "buy" option will take the user to the next activity where the user have to choose which coffee does he want? Also the machine will print
whether it can make the type of coffee chosen by the customer or not with the remaining amounts of the ingredients inside the machine.

The "fill" option will open the machine to refill the ingridients.

The "take" option will give the owner the total money in the machine.

The "remaining" option will print the remaining ingredients in the machine

The "exit" option will close the program
